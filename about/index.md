## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer passionate about bringing ideas to life through code. My playground is the .NET ecosystem, especially C#, but I also enjoy dabbling in Python and JavaScript when the problem calls for it.

I work a lot with Azure, building cloud solutions that are robust, scalable, and impactful. Iâ€™m also an IoT enthusiast and a fan of homelab tinkering â€” I love experimenting, automating, and learning by doing.

Beyond technology, Iâ€™m a proud dad to an amazing daughter, and I enjoy creating little adventures for her â€” from bedtime stories to playful comics.

I started this blog to document my journey of growth as a developer and to share what I learn along the way â€” from clean code and design patterns to cloud and IoT experiments.

Thanks for stopping by â€” I hope you find something here that inspires you.

Always curious, always building.

â€“ Filipe
