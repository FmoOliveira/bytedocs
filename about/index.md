## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer passionate about building things and experiencing the magic when code brings ideas to life. My main playground is the .NET ecosystem, especially C#, but I also enjoy working with Python and JavaScript. 

In the cloud, Azure is my go-to platform, where I solve problems and craft solutions. I started this blog to document my journey to becoming a better developer and building a stronger career. Here, you'll find posts on algorithms, software design patterns, and development best practices.

I'm also an IoT and homelab enthusiast, always tinkering with new projects. Beyond tech, I'm a proud father to an amazing 3-year-old daughter. I love creating things for her, from storytelling adventures to comics.

This blog is where my passion for technology and creativity come together. I hope you find something here that inspires you.

Let's build something awesome together!

â€“ Filipe
